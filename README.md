# glue-lib

This library provides functionality for gluing component instances to other component instances in SketchUp.

This workaround lib is no longer needed once https://github.com/SketchUp/api-issue-tracker/issues/111 is implemented.

## Installation

1. Copy the file(s) into your extension's directory.
2. Wrap the content of the file(s) in your extension's namespace.
3. Require the file(s) where you need their functionality.
4. ????
5. Profit!
